# blog_back

My first django project. Mistakes were made.

Backend for the project blog.
Vue 3 frontend is here: [front](https://github.com/KirillZorikov/blog_front).

Production version on a running server: http://kz-projects.tk/blog

Api: https://kz-api.tk/blog/api/v1

Admin panel: https://kz-api.tk/admin_panel

There is also a [django_templates](https://github.com/KirillZorikov/blog_back/tree/main/django_templates) dir covered with unit tests. This part is outdated and needs to be improved.

It's a project where authors can publish posts. Users can rate and comment them, as well as subscribe to their favorite authors.
